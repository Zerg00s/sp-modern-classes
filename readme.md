## How do I use these CSS classes?
### Column formatting, view formatting, form formatting
You can use column and view formatting to customize how fields in SharePoint lists and libraries are displayed. To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements.

#### Sample JSON formatting for a SharePoint Title field:
- Format a column

- Apply a sample sp-field-dataBars CSS class to the Title field:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/column-formatting.schema.json",
  "elmType": "div",
  "txtContent": "@currentField",
  "attributes": {
    "class": "sp-field-dataBars"
  }
}
```

### SPFx Webparts
In SPFx web parts, you can reuse the classes by using the className attribute. For example, to apply a border to a field, you can use the sp-field-borderAllDashed class:

```html
<div className={`sp-field-dataBars sp-field-borderAllDashed`}>
```
